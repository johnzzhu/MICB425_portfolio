## Origins and Earth Systems
### Evidence worksheet 01
[Whitman *et al* 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33863/)

#### Learning objectives
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems. 

#### General questions
* What were the main questions being asked?

    What is the total number, density, carbon mass, growth and turnover rates of prokaryotic organisms in aquatic, soil, and subsurface environments?
    
* What were the primary methodological approaches used?
    
    This study is a review of other published literature. The authors presented data from other studies of aquatic, soil, and subsurface environments, and presented them in a tabular form. The authors then extrapolate the remaining data so that values of cell densities, abundances, and carbon contents are complete for each environment. Lastly the authors conduct comparative analyses based on these data and address these questions.  

* Summarize the main results or findings.  

    * Total prokaryotic carbon on Earth is estimated to be 60~100% of the carbon mass found in plants.
    * Prokaryotes have approx. one order of magnitude more of total N and P mass than that in plants, because they contain much more N and P relative to carbon than plants do.
    * Total protoplasmic biomass on Earth in microbes is far higher than plants
    * Lower limit in prokaryotic turnover time ranges from 6-25 days to ~1000 days (1-2 thousand years for subsurface bacteria, however it is far longer than expected and is based on one sample) 
    * 0.4, 0.5, 3.4, and 170 hours avg for 4 mutations from the pool of all genes shared by marine heterotrophs (in the upper 200 m), marine autotrophs, soil prokaryotes, or prokaryotes in domestic animals
    * 60 years avg for 5 mutations from the pool of all genes shared by all 4 groups    


* Do new questions arise from the results?  

    Why is the subsurface turnover rate so slow?  
    Which hypothesis is true: metabolic inactivity, lithotrophic metabolism, overestimation of subsurface biomass, underestimation of carbon assimilation?  

* Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?  

    Could clarify what is “four simultaneous mutations in every gene shared by the populations of marine heterotrophs” a bit more. 


### Problem set 01
#### Learning objectives: 
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

#### Specific questions:
* What are the primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth and how do they vary with respect to their capacity to support life? Provide a breakdown of total cell abundance for each primary habitat from the tables provided in the text.  

    The habitats are **aquatic, soil,** and **subsurface**  
    
    Total cell abundances:  
    
    Aquatic: \(1.181E29\) cells  
    Soil:   \(2.556E29\) cells  
    Subsurface: \(3.8E30\) cells

* What is the estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean and what fraction of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Prochlorococcus? What is the significance of this ratio with respect to carbon cycling in the ocean and the atmospheric composition of the Earth?  

    The estimated prokaryotic cell abundance is 5E5 cells/mL, or 360E26 cells total.  
    Marine cyanobacteria & Procholorococcus account for 4E4 of the cells per mL, or 8% of all prokaryotic cells in the top 200m.  
    They are responsible for atmospheric oxygenation and carbon assimilation.

* What is the difference between an autotroph, heterotroph, and a lithotroph based on information provided in the text?   

    Autotroph: Energy source independent of organic substrates  
    Heterotroph: Energy source from organic carbon substrates  
    Lithotroph: Energy source from inorganic substrates  

* Based on information provided in the text and your knowledge of geography what is the deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this depth?  
    
    At a subsurface depth of 4km, the average temperature is 125C.  
    This is close to the temperature limit for prokaryotic life.  
    The high temperature is likely due to geothermal processes.  
    On average, the temperature increases by 22 degrees Celsius per km depth.

* Based on information provided in the text your knowledge of geography what is the highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this height?  

    Prokaryotic life has been detected in the air at very low qualtities up to 57-77km (more likely 20km realistically).  
    The low temperature & pressure as well as extreme solar radiation are limiting factors at this height.  
    However it is arguable that the atmosphere is capable of supporting growth (as opposed to transport) due to the lack of many essential nutrients at any appreciable concentrations.

* Based on estimates of prokaryotic habitat limitation, what is the vertical distance of the Earth’s biosphere measured in km?  

    If including the atmosphere, Earth's biosphere spans from approx. 20km above the summit of Mt. Everest to approx. 4.5km below the Marianas Trench. This amounts to approx. 44km. 

* How was annual cellular production of prokaryotes described in Table 7 column four determined? (Provide an example of the calculation)  

    Annual cellular production is the population size mutiplied by the number of turnover periods in a year.  
    For marine heterotrophs above 200m:  
    Population size = \(3.6E28\) cells  
    Turnover period = \(16\) days  
    Annual cellular production = population * turnover/yr = \(3.6E28\frac{365}{16} = 8.215E29\) cells/yr  
    *Aside*: Viruses play a significant role in driving this turnover. Viruses often carry accesorry metabolism genes (AMG) which directly modulates cellular metabolism. At a larger scale, this in turn modulates the metabolism of the community.

* What is the relationship between carbon content, carbon assimilation efficiency and turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean? Why does this vary with depth in the ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats?  

    A number of assumptions need to be made to establish these relationships.  
    
    Assuming:  
    20fg = 20E-30Pg of C per cell and  
    3.6E28 marine heterophs in the upper 200m  
    We can estimate that there are:  
    3.6E28 * 2E-30 = 0.72Pg C in marine heterotrophs in the upper 200m  
    
    Assuming:  
    20% carbon assimilation efficiency (growth efficiency, substrate use efficiency)  
    We can estimate that amount of C required per turnover to be:  
    4 * 0.72 = 2.88Pg (unclear why the author used a factor of 4 instead of 5)  
    
    Assuming:  
    The net primary production in terms of C is 51Pg/yr and  
    85% of it is consumed in the top 200m, all by prokaryotes  
    We can estimate that the amount of C available per year is:  
    51 * 0.85 = 43Pg/yr  
    
    This works out to 43/2.88 = 14.9 turnovers per year or 24.5 days  

* How were the frequency numbers for four simultaneous mutations in shared genes determined for marine heterotrophs and marine autotrophs given an average mutation rate of 4 x 10^-7^ per DNA replication? (Provide an example of the calculation with units. Hint: cell and generation cancel out)  

    The probability of 4 simultaneous mutations would be (4E-7)^4^ = 2.56E-26 per replication.  
    
    Given the turnover rate to be 8.215E29 cells/yr from a previous question, then there is an average of 8.2E29 * 2.56E-26 = 2.1E4 four simultaneous mutation events per year, or about 0.4 per hour.


* Given the large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, what are the implications with respect to genetic diversity and adaptive potential? Are point mutations the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt?  

    The prokaryotic genomes have tremendous abilities to change given high mutation rates, large population size, and rapid turnover rates. By accumulating mutations not only through point mutations but also through insertion, deletion, HGT and recombination, mutations can rapidly spread horizontally and vertically. This makes the world of prokaryotes incredibly diverse and adaptable to any kind of biologically viable habitat.

* What relationships can be inferred between prokaryotic abundance, diversity, and metabolic potential based on the information provided in the text?  
    
    Since there is high diversity, there is also a wide range of metabolic capabilities.  
    Since there is also high abundance, the impact/extent of metabolism on the Earth is also very large - enough to oxygenate the atmosphere, for example.
